        <h1>Backburner</h1>
        <p>
            I can't lie, it feels nice that you're calling
You sound sad and alone, and you're stalling
And for once, I don't care about what you want
As long as we keep talking (as long as we're talking)
I mean, you gotta admit the history's kind of unmatched
Asian Calvinism, we made it out of that
Well, whether we're free of will or predestined
Clearly, I've not learned my lesson even now
Hope He doesn't strike me down (strike me down)
The Goo Goo Dolls are dead to me
The way you should be too
But you bring them up
Along with how much I fucking miss you
Maybe I'm just not better than this, I haven't tried
Maybe life's less romantic when I don't wanna die
You'd think I'd be a fast learner
But guess I won't ever mind crisping up on your backburner
Backburner
Your backburner
Your backburner
Your backburner
It's pathetic, but at least you are, too
I don't know what to do
I don't like anyone except sometimes you
And now you're sounding like a hurt puppy
You look ugly when you cry
But I'm the one you think to call
How do you feel lucky and appalled at the same time?
After everything you put me through
I somehow still believe in you, oh-oh
But I know in a week or so
You'll fade away again
And I wish that I cared
Hey, are you still there?
Good
Maybe I'm just not better than this, I haven't tried
'Cause maybe you'll finally choose me after you've had more time
I thought I was a fast learner
But guess I won't ever mind, guess I won't ever mind
Maybe I blame my mother bleeding into my stride
Maybe it was my father and his wandering eyes
(It's their fault that)
I'll always be in your corner
'Cause I don't feel alive 'til I'm burnin' on your backburner, oh-oh
(Backburner, your backburner)
And I know that it's sad that I settle for the backburner, oh-oh (your backburner)
(Your backburner, your backburner)
Guess I won't ever mind crisping up on your backburner, oh-oh (your backburner)
(Backburner, your backburner)
As long as you still think of me, oh, oh-oh (backburner, backburner)
        </p>

        <h1>Take A Chance With Me</h1>

        <p>
            His laugh you'd die for, his laugh you'd die for
            The kind that colors the sky
            Heart intangible, slips away faster than
            Dandelion fluff in the sunlight
            And he's got swirls of passion in his eyes
            Uncoverin' the dreams, he dreams at night
            As much and hard as he tries to hide
            I can see right through, see right through
            His voice you'd melt for, he says my name like
            I'd fade away somehow if he's too loud
            What I would give for me to get my feet
            Back on the ground, head off the clouds
            I laugh at how we're polar opposites
            I read him like a book, and he's a clueless little kid
            Doesn't know that I'd stop time and space
            Just to make him smile, make him smile
            Oh, why can't we for once
            Say what we want, say what we feel?
            Oh, why can't you for once
            Disregard the world, and run to what you know is real?
            Take a chance with me, take a chance with me
            Ooh-ooh, ooh-ooh
            Ooh-ooh, ooh-ooh
            His kiss you'd kill for, just one and you're done for
            Electricity surgin' in the air
            He drives me crazy, it's so beyond me
            How he'd look me dead in the eye and stay unaware
            That I'm hopelessly captivated
            By a boy who thinks love's overrated
            How did I get myself in this arrangement?
            It baffles me, too, baffles me, too
            Oh, why can't we for once
            Say what we want, say what we feel?
            Oh, why can't you for once
            Disregard the world, and run to what you know is real?
            In the end we only regret the chances we didn't take
            I'll be your safety net, so why not raise the stakes?
            And I can hear your heart from across the room
            Pulsin' through my veins, I know you need this too
            Lie to me all you please, I can see right through
            See right through
            Oh, why can't we for once
            Say what we want, say what we feel?
            Oh, why can't you for once
            Disregard the world, and run to what you know is real?
            Oh, why can't we for once
            Say what we want, say what we feel?
            Oh, why can't you for once
            Disregard the world, and run to what you know is real?
            Take a chance with me, take a chance with me
            Ooh-ah, oh-oh, oh
        </p>

        <h1>Keeping Tabs</h1>
        <p>
            Loser
            Ah, ah
            You left without saying goodbye (fuck, fuck, fuck)
            Don't cry, don't cry, don't cry, don't cry
            I ball a fist and die inside
            I wish I didn't, but regrettably, I entirely understand why you did it
            Take one step forward and two jumps back
            One hand on the gate of this cul-de-sac
            Some cursed part of me wants to be cornered
            Right into it even if we crack
            You left early and you arrived too late
            Just right in time to be a huge mistake
            So I wish you well, and I wish you far away
            This was never real, I'll say it 'til I believe it
            I wish I never met you
            You are the worst thing that I'm still
            Keeping tabs on for some stupid reason
            You were just being nice
            Now I fully believe you're out there somewhere also
            Keeping tabs on how I might be feeling
            For some stupid reason
            I keep on believing
            You care and you're reeling too
            I don't even know you
            Drowning in my own
            Sad, imagined fantasy of who you could be
            The reality is you
            Unironically love personality tests
            All of the data's weak, half-amusing at best
            But it could never work 'cause I'm an Enneatype 4 Aquarius
            You say the wrong thing every time you talk
            The red flags wave, the alarms sound off
            I'm so glad our paths didn't cross
            I'm so glad, I'll say it 'til I believe it
            I wish I never met you
            You are the worst thing that I'm still
            Keeping tabs on for some stupid reason
            You're the same with everyone
            I'm not special, no, you're not out there just
            Keeping tabs on how I might be feeling
            That's all just imagined
            I keep on believing
            You care and you miss me too
            I need to get over you
            Oh, oh
            I need to get over you
        </p>

        <h1>Every Summertime</h1>
        <p>
            18, we were undergrads
            Stayed out late, never made it to class, uh
            Outer Richmond in a taxi cab
            You were sweating bullets on the way to my dad's and oh
            You said, "Baby, think we're moving too fast", ah-ah
            And I swear the magnolias flashed a smile (flashed a smile)
            And that's when I caught me hoping you'd stay a while (stay a while)
            Baby, I'd give up anything to travel inside your mind
            Baby, I fall in love again come every summertime
            My daddy taught me to choose 'em wisely, but you don't have to try
            'Cause, baby, I fall in love every summertime
            25, man we're missing church
            Laugh 'bout everyone we're hating at work
            Dinner with your sister and the jokes kinda hurt
            Cry the way home, and you're putting me first, oh
            Yeah, we just always know what to say (mh, ah, yeah)
            We're strolling down the boulevard
            And dancing under streetlights (oh, the lights)
            Every year we get older, and I'm still on your side (oh, I)
            Baby, I'd give up anything to travel inside your mind
            Baby, I fall in love again come every summertime
            My daddy taught me to choose 'em wisely, but you don't have to try
            'Cause, baby, I fall in love every summertime
            Every day is summertime
            Every day is summertime
            Every day is summertime with you
            Every day is summertime
            Every day is summertime
            Every day is summertime with you
        </p>
        
        <h1>Autumn</h1>
        <p>
            I carved my name into your ribcage
We talked of lands away from this cage
You said, "Don't fret love, someday I'll be my own man, I'll be free"
Oh, but darlin' did you mean, darlin', did you mean free from me?
You promised home
The kind I'd never known, oh
But here we are, skin and flesh and beating hearts
And I'm wondering what the hell I'm doing wrong
You said, "Let's make ourselves our very own brigade
This love our shield, our blade"
Oh, but darlin', do you see the cuts from which I bleed?
It's me you've slain
I didn't obliterate these walls for you
To come and raid my home
And here you are right next to me
Ironically, I've never felt more alone
I fell for you faster than I fell apart
And I guess I'm the one to blame
For letting myself fall too hard
I ripped my heart out and put it in your hands
In hopes that we'd put up a fight
How paradoxical
Since now all I can think about
Is when will we stop trying
Oh
Oh-oh-oh
How do we stay afloat?
When do I let go?
All you do is blindside me, it's hard to be brave
But when the night cuts into the day, it's your love I crave
I must've thanked my lucky stars too much
They left me sitting in too much dust, mmm, oh
You know all my dreams
You were one, so it seemed
And I love you but with you
It's heartache I breathe
You gave it your all
Just with everything you took from me
Oh, my love
Is this the end for us?
Maybe we've had enough
 </p>
        <h1>Before</h1>
        <p>
            You hid me in your dorm room, it was Halloweekend
I just flew across the globe, 22 hours just to see you
Just to barely fit on your twin-sized bed
And talk about your cool new friend
Who I never met, who you dated as soon as I left
Carolina autumn, it had been a year since I saw ya
Since we ended it, had a year to grow into the girl you always wanted
Now we're holding hands as not quite friends, but not quite lovers
Well, we'll just pretend
You say, "It's complicated to make amends"
Well, is that the way that we're headed, then?
And you couldn't answer me
Though you could pull me in while I brushed my teeth
And let your hands both freely speak
Like I wasn't ever gonna leave
You were all I'd ever known
And now I'm supposed to love you from a distance
Like it's nothing, like it's instant
And you say, "Let's just see where this goes"
And I don't know how or why you seem just fine
'Cause I'm having to grasp that you're somehow not mine anymore
It's so cruel how things are only almost like they were before
(Ah, ah, ah)
Like they were before (ah, ah, ah)
Like they were before (ah, ah, ah)
Like they were before (ah, ah, ah)
We walk downtown and it's charming
You're alarmingly disarming
Yeah, we've got 48 hours left before I fly back to my death
While you stay just fine and feel alive
South of the Mason-Dixon line
Where everyone closes shop at nine
Where you could somehow finally find
What you were desperately looking for
Funny how you thought that was gonna be New York
With our chalkboard walls and slanted floors
Oh, we could've had that and so much more
Ask your new lover what it's like to be given
A real fighting chance before you wish her, "Good riddance"
Did anything ever really count
Or was I just a two-year practice round?
You were all I'd ever known
And now I'm feeling stupid, you're forbidden
They say, yeah, we were something, too bad we were children
Ooh, I don't know where to go
And I don't know how or why you seem just fine
'Cause I'm looking at you and God knows you're not mine anymore
It's so cruel how things will never be the way they were before
(Ah, ah, ah)
Like they were before (ah, ah, ah)
It's almost just like how it was before (ah, ah, ah)
But it's not anymore
        </p>
        <h1>Facebook Friends</h1>
        <p>
            Wonder what's in the cards for us
Maybe it's just to keep our distance
And stay friends on Facebook (Facebook)
Or maybe I'll get to know you again, and
Tell a sentence from a single look
I don't know what you've been up to these days
Probably involves a lot of vinyl and seeking status
I can't spare the bitter malice
Not while you're forgetting me (not while you're forgetting me)
But in the rare case that I do cross your mind
I hope you know, you always cross mine
And I can honestly tell you
I've been doing fine, but I've done better, hm
I've been better, I've been better, uh
I wish we met now
Oh, I wish you met this me
I'm pretty sure I know what peace means now
But as always, I was late
And as always you couldn't wait, hm
Well, anyway
In the rare case that I do cross your mind
You better know, you always cross mine
And I can honestly tell you
That I've really been trying to go and find better, hm
There's no one better, there's no one better
Some days are easier than others
And most nights, I don't feel like a half
And it doesn't hurt as much to think of your lips on another
But I miss hearing you laugh
So, maybe once more, we'll cross paths
Or maybe we won't
Either way, I'll keep you in this song
And I don't know, maybe it doesn't have to be so wrong to try again
But for now, we'll stay Facebook friends
Oh-ooh, woah-oh
        </p>
        <h1>Anaheim</h1>
        <p>
            If I could I'd freeze this moment, make it my home
You're all I want to want to know
I can tell you mean it when you kiss me slow
But please don't ask me, the answer's no
In a perfect world, I'd kill to love you the loudest
But all I do is live to hurt you soundless
Say you see I'm lying, babe, and let this go
I can never promise you tomorrow
'Cause I have yet to learn
How not to be his
This city will surely burn
If we keep this as it is
I'd give anything to stop time
And drive around Anaheim at sun down
To teach my mind to put you first
Here you are, a hero
You wanna be my new home
But baby, let up
I won't ever recognize these roads
'Cause I am lost, but not in you
Yes, I am lost, but not in you
I could spend my days studying your laugh's melody
And I can't live with myself 'cause I know you'd die for me
All I ask of you is please don't sleep
On this bed of promises I can't keep
'Cause I have yet to know
How to be mine
You can try to unearth this soul
I swear you'll hate what you find, find
Oh-oh-oh-oh-oh-oh-oh-oh
Oh-oh-oh-oh-oh-oh-oh-oh
Oh-oh-oh-oh-oh-oh-oh-oh
I'd give anything to stop time
Commit to you and not crimes
Against your truth and lose sight
Of every divide threatening to undo this story
But baby, I'm so sorry
I don't think that I'll ever memorize this route
'Cause I am lost, but not in you
Yes, I am lost, but not in you
        </p>
        <h1>Ocean and Engines</h1>
        <p>
            Saturday sunset
We're lying on my bed with five hours to go
Fingers entwined and so were our minds
Cryin', "I don't want you to go"
You wiped away your tears
But not fears under the still and clear indigo
You said, "Baby, don't cry, we'll be fine
You're the one thing I swear I can't outgrow"
My mother said the younger me was a pretending prodigy
Well, nothing then, much has changed
'Cause while you're wolfin' down liquor
My soul, it gets sicker
But I'm stickin' to the screenplay
Gotta say I'm okay, but answer this, babe
How is it now that somehow you're a strangеr?
You were mine just yеsterday
I pray the block in my airway dissipates
And instead deters your airplane's way
But heaven denied
Destiny decried
Something beautiful died
Too soon
But I'm letting go
I'm givin' up the ghost
But don't get me wrong
I'll always love you, that's why
I wrote you this very last song
I guess this is where we say goodbye
I know I'll be alright
Someday I'll be fine
But just not tonight (ooh)
Plungin' into all kinds of diversions
Like blush wine and sonorous soirées
But even with gin and surgin' adrenaline
I see you're all that can intoxicate
Oceans and engines
You're skilled at infringin' on great love affairs
'Cause now my heart's home
All I've known is long gone and ten thousand miles away
And I'm not okay
But I'm letting go
I'm giving up the ghost
But don't get me wrong
I'll always love you, that's why
I wrote you this very last song
I guess this is where we say goodbye
I know I'll be alright
But just not
Tonight was the first time I stared into seas
Of beguiling sepia two years ago
And the first time I learned real world superpowers lived in three words
They revitalize my fraying bones, oh
Now what do you do when your pillar crumbled down
You've lost all solid ground
Both dreams and demons drowned
And this void's all you've found
And doubts light it aglow?
I have so many questions
But I'm pouring them into the ocean
And I'm starting up my engine
And I'm letting go
I'm givin' up your ghost
It's come to a close
I marked the end with this last song I wrote
I'm letting go
This is the last falsetto
I'll ever sing to you
My great lost love
        </p>
        <h1>Apartment We Won't Share</h1>
        <p>
            The apartment we won't share
I wonder what sad wife lives there
Have the windows deciphered her stares?
Do the bricks in the walls know to hide the affairs?
The dog we won't have is now one I would not choose
The daughter we won't raise still waits for you
The girl I won't be is the one that's yours
I hope you shortly find what you long for
Two years and some change
Isn't it strange?
You're a full-fledged socialist
I go by a new name
The filthy joke that won't
Burrow in the corner of your
Smirking lips, I mourn it to this day
The story we won't tell
Is my greatest fantasy
The passion I won't feel again
Isn't lost on me
The son you never wanted
Is the wound your father left
And the mother I won't be is
Probably for the best
Your demons I won't meet
Now someone else's word to keep
I'm sure she's beautiful and sweet
Not what I wanted, but what we need
